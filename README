These are source scripts to analyze cache partitioning based on 
MPKI or IPCs for the project "Refining the Utility Metric for 
Utility-Based Cache Partitioning".

The description for each perl script is included at the head of 
each perl file.

data: includes accurate MPKI and CPI data, gotten from
CMP$im simulation.

predicted_cpi: contains predicted CPIs for each workload,
generated by generate_predicted_cpi.pl.

I am willing to receive bug reports for these scripts from you.
